# Impact of Federal Reserve Rate Cuts on Economic Indicators
<br>

## Project Overview
This project explores and compares the impact of two significant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts: a 150-basis-point reduction in March 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, and a more moderate 50-basis-point cut in September 2024 aimed at supporting economic stability. By analyzing key economic indicators such as the NASDAQ Composite, Unemployment Rate, Inflation, and the 10-Year Treasury Yield, we seek to understand how varying economic contexts influence the effectiveness of monetary policy.

Using statistical methods and data visualizations, this analysis sheds light on the nuances of the Fed's actions, providing insights into the broader economic implications of interest rate changes. This project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how monetary policy can shape investor sentiment, affect employment levels, and influence inflationary trends under different economic conditions.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to compare and analyze the economic impacts of the 2020 and 2024 Fed rate cuts by:
- Examining correlations between economic indicators before and after each rate cut.
- Quantifying the response of key indicators such as the NASDAQ Composite, Unemployment Rate, Inflation, and the 10-Year Treasury Yield.
- Understanding the broader implications of these changes on investor confidence, employment trends, and inflation.

Each section of the notebook is organized to facilitate learning, and users are encouraged to explore the code, modify parameters, and experiment with different statistical methods to gain additional insights.
<br><br><br>

## Methodology
The project employs the following methods to analyze the impact of the rate cuts:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Relevant data on NASDAQ Composite, Unemployment Rate, Inflation, 10-Year Treasury Yield, and Federal Funds Rate is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
- Statistical Analysis: The notebook applies various statistical tests, including correlation analysis, paired t-tests, and cumulative returns analysis, to quantify changes before and after the rate cuts.
- Data Visualization: To facilitate interpretation, visualizations such as heatmaps, line plots, and bar charts are used to highlight the relationships between indicators and the changes in response to the Fed’s actions.
<br><br><br>

## Results and Insights
The analysis provides insights into how the Fed’s monetary policy influences financial markets and key economic indicators:

NASDAQ Composite: Responses varied between the two periods, with the 2020 rate cut causing significant volatility, while the 2024 cut had a more stable impact.
Labor Market: Unemployment surged in 2020, reflecting the COVID-19 crisis, whereas it remained steady in 2024, indicating a more stable economy.
Inflation and Treasury Yields: Changes in these indicators highlight differing economic environments and market sentiments in 2020 and 2024, underscoring the complex relationship between interest rates and broader economic performance.

## Future Work
Potential extensions of this project could include:
- Incorporating machine learning techniques to predict market responses to future rate changes.
- Expanding the analysis to cover additional economic indicators, such as housing starts or consumer spending.
- Conducting similar analyses on rate changes by other central banks to understand global monetary policy impacts.
